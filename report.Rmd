## Motivation
Los Angeles is a city of vibrant diversity and a lively urban landscape—but it’s also a city where the dynamics of crime can vary widely across neighborhoods, demographic groups, and even times of day. For law enforcement, policymakers, and community members alike, understanding these complex crime patterns is key to fostering safer and more resilient communities.\
Our project dives into the Los Angeles Police Department crime dataset to uncover the "who, what, where, and when" of crime across LA's diverse neighborhoods. We're on a mission to decode the patterns of crime by exploring how different demographics, time frames, and locations shape the city's unique crime profile. Whether it's catching late-night trends, uncovering hotspots, or spotlighting demographic factors, we’re here to map the hidden story of LA’s crime scene and uncover what drives certain areas' steady patterns—or sudden disruptions!\

## Related work
For HW5, we worked with data on homicides in 50 large U.S. cities. Our group found this dataset incredibly meaningful and decided to explore it further. To expand our research, we selected the "Crime Patterns and Trends in Recent Years - LA" dataset. This dataset includes latitude and longitude information, which inspired us to create a map-based visualization.\

\
Building on the Shiny introduced in class, we realized that Shiny would be an excellent tool for analyzing and visualizing this dataset. By implementing interactive filters, we can create dynamic visualizations tailored to specific insights we want to uncover. Overall, this assignment and the course material have been instrumental in motivating us to select this dataset and approach, providing both the direction and tools for our project.\

\

By utilizing advanced visualization and analysis tools, we aim to contribute to a deeper understanding of these issues, potentially helping policymakers and communities address crime more comprehensively.\

## Initial questions



## Data
The source dataset is the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) crime dataset, which contains all cases received by the LAPD from January 1, 2020 to September 30, 2024, and contains 982638 observations and 28 variables. After deleting variables such as weapon_cd, weapon_desc, etc., which contain a large number of missing values, the variables that are not needed are further deleted according to the needs of this project.The final data used for analysis contains the following variables:\
\
-   `dr_no`: Unique identifier for each reported crime.\
-   `date_occ`: Date the crime occurred.\
-   `time_occ`: Time the crime occurred.\
-   `serious_level`: Indicates whether the crime is a "1" (serious) or "2" (less serious) offense.
-   `crime_type`: Description of the type of crime [eg.VEHICLE - STOLEN, VANDALISM - MISDEAMEANOR ($399 OR UNDER)]\
-   `vict_age`: Age of the victim.\
-   `vict_sex`: Sex of the victim.\
-   `vict_descent`: Racial or ethnic background of the victim.\
-   `rpt_dist_no`: Reporting district number.\
-   `premis_cd`: Premises code (e.g., residential, commercial).\
-   `premis_desc`: Concatenation of the sighting session day and month.
-   `status`: Description of the case status. (eg. Invest Cont, Juv Other).\
-   `lat`: Latitude coordinates of the crime location.\
-   `long`: Longitude coordinates of the crime location.\

## Exploratory analysis
The Exploratory analysis of our project is divided into three main sections: Victim Demographic, Time Trend, and Location.\
\
(victim_demo part)
\
In the Time Trend analysis section, we examine crime data from four temporal perspectives: yearly, seasonally, weekdays, and hourly. Bar plots are used to show the total number of crimes for each time period, with stacked bar plots comparing the counts of serious and less serious crimes. To further explore spatial variations, interactive line charts created with `Plotly` visualize the temporal trends in crime counts across different areas. Finally, line charts are also used to display changes in crime counts over time by crime type, providing insights into patterns of criminal activity.\
\
(location part)
\
After finished on analyzing patterns and trends in crime occurrences based on various time scales, such as yearly, seasonal, weekdays, and hourly, visualizing how crime evolves over time and across different dimensions, examing distribution of primary crime locations, exploring geospatial mapping data and modes of different crime types, as well as the number of crimes in each area. We decide to bring these insights to life, we chose to use Shiny to create an interactive dashboard. This allows users to apply filters based on different areas in LA and time trends, enabling them to observe crime counts and distributions dynamically.\
\
For the shiny, we specifically selected data from 2023 instead of including all available time periods. This decision was made because 2023 represents the most recent year with complete data and is unaffected by the disruptions caused by the pandemic, ensuring a clearer and more relevant analysis.

## Discussion



## Data Source
This is a dataset of recent crime data from Los Angeles, covering a wide range of crime types, from violent crimes like homicide and assault to property crimes like theft and burglary. The data is carefully organized, providing insights into crime trends, geographic differences, and temporal patterns. The dataset can be downloaded directly from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arpitsinghaiml/u-s-crime-dataset/data.
