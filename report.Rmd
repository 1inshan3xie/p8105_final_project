## Motivation
Los Angeles is a city of vibrant diversity and a lively urban landscape—but it’s also a city where the dynamics of crime can vary widely across neighborhoods, demographic groups, and even times of day. For law enforcement, policymakers, and community members alike, understanding these complex crime patterns is key to fostering safer and more resilient communities.\
Our project dives into the Los Angeles Police Department crime dataset to uncover the "who, what, where, and when" of crime across LA's diverse neighborhoods. We're on a mission to decode the patterns of crime by exploring how different demographics, time frames, and locations shape the city's unique crime profile. Whether it's catching late-night trends, uncovering hotspots, or spotlighting demographic factors, we’re here to map the hidden story of LA’s crime scene and uncover what drives certain areas' steady patterns—or sudden disruptions!\

## Related work
For HW5, we worked with data on homicides in 50 large U.S. cities. Our group found this dataset incredibly meaningful and decided to explore it further. To expand our research, we selected the "Crime Patterns and Trends in Recent Years - LA" dataset. This dataset includes latitude and longitude information, which inspired us to create a map-based visualization.\

\
Building on the Shiny introduced in class, we realized that Shiny would be an excellent tool for analyzing and visualizing this dataset. By implementing interactive filters, we can create dynamic visualizations tailored to specific insights we want to uncover. Overall, this assignment and the course material have been instrumental in motivating us to select this dataset and approach, providing both the direction and tools for our project.\

\

By utilizing advanced visualization and analysis tools, we aim to contribute to a deeper understanding of these issues, potentially helping policymakers and communities address crime more comprehensively.\

## Initial questions
We’re on a mission to decode the patterns of crime by exploring how different demographics, time frames, and locations shape the city's unique crime profile. We are interested in:\
**1.**What does the general demographic profile of victims look like? What’s the distribution of their races, genders and ages?\
**2.**What is the distribution of crime across time dimensions? What if analyzing in terms of hours, weekdays, seasons and years?\
**3.**How crime is associated with location information? What does the geographic maps and spatial distribution look like?\

## Data
The source dataset is the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) crime dataset, which contains all cases received by the LAPD from January 1, 2020 to September 30, 2024, and contains 982638 observations and 28 variables. After deleting variables such as weapon_cd, weapon_desc, etc., which contain a large number of missing values, the variables that are not needed are further deleted according to the needs of this project.The final data used for analysis contains the following variables:\
\
-   `dr_no`: Unique identifier for each reported crime.\
-   `date_occ`: Date the crime occurred.\
-   `time_occ`: Time the crime occurred.\
-   `serious_level`: Indicates whether the crime is a "1" (serious) or "2" (less serious) offense.
-   `crime_type`: Description of the type of crime [eg.VEHICLE - STOLEN, VANDALISM - MISDEAMEANOR ($399 OR UNDER)]\
-   `vict_age`: Age of the victim.\
-   `vict_sex`: Sex of the victim.\
-   `vict_descent`: Racial or ethnic background of the victim.\
-   `rpt_dist_no`: Reporting district number.\
-   `premis_cd`: Premises code (e.g., residential, commercial).\
-   `premis_desc`: Concatenation of the sighting session day and month.
-   `status`: Description of the case status. (eg. Invest Cont, Juv Other).\
-   `lat`: Latitude coordinates of the crime location.\
-   `long`: Longitude coordinates of the crime location.\

## Exploratory analysis
The Exploratory analysis of our project is divided into three main sections: Victim Demographic, Time Trend, and Location.\
\
(victim_demo part)
\
In the Time Trend analysis section, we examine crime data from four temporal perspectives: yearly, seasonally, weekdays, and hourly. Bar plots are used to show the total number of crimes for each time period, with stacked bar plots comparing the counts of serious and less serious crimes. To further explore spatial variations, interactive line charts created with `Plotly` visualize the temporal trends in crime counts across different areas. Finally, line charts are also used to display changes in crime counts over time by crime type, providing insights into patterns of criminal activity.\
\
In the Location analysis section, according to the existing location information of crimes in LA, including the area names, the premises types, the geographic coordinators, the serious levels and the status of crimes occurring, we do some exploratory analysis to further understand the distribution of crimes. For visualization, we first use barplots to show the distribution of crimes and their serious levels(1 for serious and 2 for non-serious) in terms of their areas, premises and crime status. Areas like 77th Street and Central have large numbers of total crimes and serious criminal acts. What’s more, the crimes with continued investigations status are much more than other types of status. Using longitude and latitude information, we combine the visualization results with the geographic and interactive map to better reflect the different dimensions(serious level, crime status, etc.) of crimes information.\
\
After finished on analyzing patterns and trends in crime occurrences based on various time scales, such as yearly, seasonal, weekdays, and hourly, visualizing how crime evolves over time and across different dimensions, examing distribution of primary crime locations, exploring geospatial mapping data and modes of different crime types, as well as the number of crimes in each area. We decide to bring these insights to life, we chose to use Shiny to create an interactive dashboard. This allows users to apply filters based on different areas in LA and time trends, enabling them to observe crime counts and distributions dynamically.\
\
For the shiny, we specifically selected data from 2023 instead of including all available time periods. This decision was made because 2023 represents the most recent year with complete data and is unaffected by the disruptions caused by the pandemic, ensuring a clearer and more relevant analysis.\

## Additional analysis
**1. Chi-Squared Test**\
**1.1 Chi-Squared Test Between Age Group and Crime Severity**\
(xyw's part)
\
**1.2 Chi-Squared Test Between Different Time Period and Crime Severity**\
The chi-squared statistic for yearl-difference is 387.8, p-value < 2.2e-16; while for seasonal difference, the X-squared = 58.749, p-value = 1.088e-12. For difference between weekdays, the X-squared = 262.23, whose p-value is less than 2.2e-16. And for the difference in different hour period of the day, the X-squared is 13747,p-value < 2.2e-16. All these test result shows that there are significant differences in the distribution of severity of cases between different year, seasons, weekdays and hour periods of the day.\
\
**1.3 Chi-Squared Test between serious levels and areas & premise types**\
Using chi-squared test combining with heatmaps, we can find significant differences of crime serious levels in different areas and premise types. Also, the premise types of crimes in different areas are also significantly different. In testing relationship between crime seriousness level and areas, the Chi-Square Statistic is 2858.69, indicating a very high dependence between serious level and area in LA. In testing relationship between the type of premises and the serious level of incidents, the Chi-Square statistic is 182154.31, indicating a very high dependence between serious level and premises types. In testing the relationship between the type of premises and different areas, the Chi-Square statistic is 179318.97, indicating a very high dependence between areas and premises types. \
